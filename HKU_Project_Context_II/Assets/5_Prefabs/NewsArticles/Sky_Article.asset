  title: '! BREAKING NEWS ! ! BREAKING NEWS !! '
  intro: An unprecedented event took place this afternoon in the prairie roads of
    Indianapolis, where an accident occurred between two drivers after being hit
    by what seemed to be a small meteorite. Upon further investigation it actually
    turned out to be space debris from Russian Proton rockets launched from the Baikonur
    cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Findings show how more space debris is dangerously
    clumping together in orbit, posing multiple threats for lives on Earth.

  outro: "Lastly, air pollution and thrash raining from the skies seems as a reality
    no one wishes to live in. How can companies stay silent as their choices seem
    to affect everyone. Drastic changes in the way we live are necessary before we\u2019ll
    look at a thrash-riddled planet and poison the well we drink from. Potentially
    causing a mass-extinction on a world-wide scale. "
