  outro: Everyone is ordered to evacuate the surrounding areas and find shelter in
    the appointed locations. Due to the fumes and pollution caused by the catastrophe
    the government is classifying this as a massive ecological disaster. Not only
    affecting the lives of millions of people, but also causing irreversible damage
    to the fragile ecosystems of the area. Justice must be served to the one responsible
    for this careless, cruel and unnecessary disaster.
